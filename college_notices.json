However, the Maharashtra State Board has chosen our college to be a Centre for the July 2023 HSC exams, and 461 students are currently appearing for these exams, using most of our available space. The last major exam day is 3 rd Aug, 2023. During these exams, there are Board practical exams as well. The New Education Policy has also been implemented in the Senior College from this academic year, which has necessitated the use of even more space in the College. Hence F.Y.J.C. classes will not begin before the end of July. Please check our website periodically to find out details about when we will have the orientation and begin classes.
